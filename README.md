this project was meant to be generic and easy-to-use, but since it requires the user to fully manage the information themselves, it's tedious to track such things and it ends up outdated (for example, tabs open in the browser and forgetting to update this app..)

for a more tailor-built project specifically for playlist (m3u8) files, see https://github.com/violet4/playlist_player ; this project was specifically built with `Security Now!` podcast, but with enough interest, it can be adapted to other podcasts and playlist files as well.
